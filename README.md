# Date Management and Holiday Tracking Application

## Overview
This PowerApps Canvas App solution allows users to generate a list of dates based on a specified date range, manage federal and custom holidays, determine actual dates for variable holidays, and export the data to CSV and SharePoint List. This allows the user to easily generate a present and future list of dates for future holidays to use in business date calcuates as a date table.

## Features

- **Holiday Management**: Manage predefined federal holidays and custom holidays, including recurring rules.
- **Variable Holiday Calculation**: Determine the actual date for holidays that occur on variable dates (e.g., 3rd Monday of January).
- **Data Export**: Export the date range and holiday information to CSV and SharePoint.
